## Projects and Research

**QRAgent: Building Research Agents using Reinforcement Learning** -- 2025 - Present



**Autonomous Drone Swarm Navigation** -- 2023 - 2024
- Built flight control and planning software for an autonomous drone swarm system for land surveillance and disaster response
- Developed flight planning UI integrated with custom ; integrated YOLOv3 CNN for object detection from live camera feed
- Executed multiple autonomous test flights; awarded $10k+ funding and 2nd place out of 30+ teams for engineering design

**Reducing Hallucinations in Medical Q&A LLMs** 2024
- Did a research project on reducing the frequency of hallucinations in medical Q&A for a final project for CIS 7000 - Foundations for LLMs, in MedAlpaca 13B model and PubMedQA dataset
- Expounded upon prior research by testing system prompts, in addition to one-shot, few-shot, and CoT prompting
- Research indicated that CoT prompts reduced the amount of hallucination, as measured by seq-log probability and Shannon Entropy

**Debiasing Language Models to Reduce ** 2018-2020
- Identified faulty moderation in online forums on sensitive discussions about race and gender, which inspired an independent research project on AI for safer debate; awarded Top 10 Regeneron STS Finalist, presented work at RE-WORK conference
- Built attention-based LSTM classifier with GloVe embeddings in Tensorflow/Keras and Python preprocessing/tokenizing pipeline
- Collaborated with Prof. Sameer Singh (UCI NLP) on a debiasing data augmentation process, reducing false positive bias by 44%

**Building RL Agents that learned to Walk in a Simulated Environment** 2017 - 2018
- Developed policy gradient agents that learned to walk in OpenAI Gym; published research with guidance from Prof. Alex Ihler
- Implemented baseline trust-region and proximal policy optimization models in Tensorforce (Tensorflow RL Implementation)
- Finetuned hyperparameters and reward functions to optimize training; used multiprocessing tools to log training
