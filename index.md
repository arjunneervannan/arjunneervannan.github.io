# Hi, I'm Arjun!

I’m a Quantitative Researcher at Goldman Sachs, where I co-founded and lead an internal reinforcement learning research lab within a $300B+ systematic investing platform.- Founded Goldman Sachs’ first reinforcement learning research lab, within a $300B+ quant investing business.

Some of my projects include the following:
- Built a modular RL training framework using VERL, Ray, vLLM, and PyTorch, now adopted as the firm-wide library for RL research
- Train Qwen3 models to trade (currently being evalauted in live trading workflows)
- Develop an AI Scientist capable of doing month-long research projects in minutes

I graduated from University of Pennsylvania's M&T Program, where I graduated with a Master's in Electrical Engineering and two Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Finance. In particular, I focused on Math and Deep Learning, including Principles of Deep Learning, Measure Theory, Stochastic Calculus, and Quantum Mechanics.

I was selected as a [Top 10 Finalist](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/2020-sts-winners/) in the Regeneron Science Talent Search for my work in building a scalable, automated debiasing process for AI model alignment.
