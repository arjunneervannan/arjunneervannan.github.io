# Hi, I'm Arjun!

I'm currently a quantitative researcher at Goldman Sachs on a team of 10 managing $250B, where I primarily specialize in the following:

- Develop AI Scientists that conduct novel quant research
- Build robust distributed and asynchronous software infra & data pipelines
- Conduct quant research for new strategies

I graduated from University of Pennsylvania's M&T Program, where I graduated with a Master's in Electrical Engineering and two Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Finance. In particular, I focused on Math and Deep Learning, including Principles of Deep Learning, Measure Theory, Stochastic Calculus, and Quantum Mechanics.

I was selected as a [Top 10 Finalist](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/2020-sts-winners/) in the Regeneron Science Talent Search for my work in building a scalable, automated debiasing process for AI model alignment.
