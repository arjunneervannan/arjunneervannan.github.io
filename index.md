# Hi, I'm Arjun!
I build AI systems and write about engineering and research.

I'm currently a quantitative researcher at Goldman Sachs on a team of 10 managing $250B, where I primarily specialize in the following:
- Write robust distributed & asynchronous software in Python to automate trading and conduct research
- Develop AI agents that can conduct factor research
- Do ML research for new strategies

I previously graduated from University of Pennsylvania's M&T Program, where I graduated with a Master's in Electrical Engineering and two Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Finance. In particular, I focused on higher-level math, including Measure Theory, Stochastic Calculus, and Quantum Mechanics.
