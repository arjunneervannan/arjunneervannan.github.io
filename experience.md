# Work Experience

**Goldman Sachs -- Quant Researcher** 2024 - Present

- Built a distributed, concurrent architecture for risk monitoring software in Python using Dask & Asyncio to systematically flag high-risk assets across $250B+, reducing runtime from ~3 hours to 20 mins and directly impacting PnL by $10M+
- Engineered ETL pipeline in Python to convert 1000+ daily free-text unstructured client inputs into structured formats, reducing error rates from ~5% to <0.1%, increasing PnL by $5M+ and reducing 1000+ hours yearly of manual data entry
- Implemented asynchronous querying/processing architecture in Python using Asyncio for a script that processes 10M+ rows of position data, improving runtime from 4 hours daily to < 5 mins, saving 1000+ hours yearly
- Built Python-based system with matrix caching deployed in production to compute portfolio risk exposure in batches across 1400+ portfolios, reducing runtime by 100x from prior approach and used in $200M+ sector strategy in Q2 2025 (see below)

**Stealth Startup -- Research Scientist Intern** 2021 - 2021
- Built attention-based LSTMs in PyTorch for an AI shopping agent, achieving 99% test accuracy and surpassing prior models
- Built cleaning/preprocessing pipeline for e-commerce corpus; added dropout, L2, and data augmentation to boost generalization
- Created interpretable attention visualizations; deployed model via an API that was used in production ML system

**UCI NLP Group -- Research Scientist** 2017 - 2020
- Identified faulty moderation in online forums on sensitive discussions about race and gender, which inspired an independent research project on AI for safer debate; awarded Top 10 Regeneron STS Finalist, presented work at RE-WORK conference
- Built attention-based LSTM classifier with GloVe embeddings in Tensorflow/Keras and Python preprocessing/tokenizing pipeline
- Collaborated with Prof. Sameer Singh (UCI NLP) on a debiasing data augmentation process, reducing false positive bias by 44%
